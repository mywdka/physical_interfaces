# Example model

This is an Edge Impulse model exported as an Arduino library. The model is trained on 'interial' (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) data collected using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and has three labels â€“ `idle`, `wave` and `updown`. You can [view or clone the project](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/204525/latest) to add data or make changes.
